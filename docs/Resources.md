Everything here requires you to send the `sessionID`, received when you `identify`.  
Each event requires different data, so look at each of them to know what to send (and what to receive).  

# Message
Every event that begins with `message`, [docs.](Resources/Message.md)  
Remember events are camelCase (like `messageCreate`)
